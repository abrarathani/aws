# 🌩️ AWS Administration Projects (Beginner-Friendly)

Welcome to the **AWS Administration Projects** repository!  
This repository is created to help beginners, system administrators, and cloud engineers learn how to use core AWS services by doing **real-world hands-on projects** step-by-step.

All projects are documented in a simple and clear way — so that even a new learner can follow and understand AWS infrastructure concepts.
